repoSpanner
===========

repoSpanner is a distributed repository storage server, based around Git.

It is designed so that all nodes are equal -- any client can push/pull
to/from any node and should see no difference at all.  Each node makes
sure that all pushed objects are synced to at least a majority of the
nodes before acknowledging the push.

The system should be resilient against any nodes failing, as long as a
majority of nodes remains available; with the worst case being a single
push failing due to an attempt to push to the failed node.

*Note*: As a consequence of this, it is strongly suggested to deploy
regions with odd numbers of nodes.


Build repoSpanner
-----------------

You will need the Go dep tool installed to build repoSpanner:

    $ dnf install dep

Followed by that:

    $ ./build.sh


Deployment
----------

A repoSpanner deployment is called a "cluster", which consists of one or
more "regions", which contain one or more "nodes".  A cluster contains
all nodes that are under the same deployment, and a region contains all
nodes that talk and synchronize amongst each other.

The `nodename.regionname.clustername` should be the FQDNs the nodes use
to communicate with their peers.

The repoSpanner binary contains all the tools needed to create the
Certificate Authority (CA) to perform the pushes.  To initiate a
cluster, run: `repospanner ca init <cluster-name>`.  E.g.:

    $ repospanner ca init repospanner.local.

To create node certificates, run: `repospanner ca node <region>
<nodename>`.  E.g.:

    $ repospanner ca node regiona nodea

To create leaf certificates (for admin and to push/pull), run:

    $ repospanner ca leaf <username>

And then arguments for whether the user is an admin (--admin), can pull
(--read), and/or push (--write); and for which regions and repositories
this certificate is valid (globbing possible), e.g.:

    $ repospanner ca leaf admin --admin --write \
        --read --region "*" --repo "*"

After creating the certificates, deploy them to the nodes, and create
configuration files (default: `/etc/repospanner/config.yml`).  Then on
the first node, invoke the following to make it initialize its databases:

    $ repospanner serve --spawn

And then, to run it:

    $ repospanner serve

Or start the `repospanner.service` unit file.  Then on any further nodes,
run: `repospanner serve --join https://<running.node.fqdn>:<rpcport>`, e.g.:

    $ repospanner serve --joinnode \
        https://nodea.regiona.repospanner.local:8443

And then run:

    repospanner serve

Or, again, start the `repospanner.service` unit file.


Repository access
-----------------

After this, the service will be available on https://<node.fqdn>/

For git repo pull/push, add a /repo/<repo-name>.git.
Example clone command for default https port on tcp/443 and repo name being "test"

```
git clone \
--config http.sslcert=/etc/pki/repospanner/someuser.crt \
--config http.sslkey=/etc/pki/repospanner/someuser.key \
--config http.sslCAinfo=/etc/pki/repospanner/<repospanner-CA>.crt \
https://nodea.regiona.repospanner.local/repo/test.git".

```

Alternatively, for ssh based pushing and pulling, make sure that the users'
entry console is the `repobridge` binary, and the client_config.yml file is setup
in /etc/repospanner.
This client will automatically revert to plain git if it determines the repo
that is being pushed to is not a repospanner repository.


Development
-----------

For development, standard github pull requests are used.
Most changes do not require special tools other than the standard build
instructions, however, if you modify any of the protobuf files, you'll need to
install the protobuf compiler:

    $ dnf install protobuf-devel

Then run `go generate ./...` to regenerate the built files.

To run all tests, run from the main directory:

    $ go test ./...


Tests
-----

The project comes with a decent functional test suite.  Explore the
`repospanner/functional_tests` to see the variety of tests that you can
run.
